# Forecast_highz_spectroscopic_survey

Codes associated to the z>2 spectroscopic survey forecast (article: ). 
As in the article, there are two categories: 
-codes for forecasting future surveys MegaMapper, MUST, MSE, WST
-codes for forecasting a general survey model, which make forecasts for a set of observational parameters (Vsur, pmin, NfibTsur...). 

## Codes for MegaMapper, MUST, MSE, WST
We forecasted BAO, RSD, NG and NM effects. For RSD and NG, they is an additional codes for the 2tracers case (MSE, NTL and MUST).

## Codes for the general survey model
These codes will be added later
