# Forecast_highz_spectroscopic_survey

Codes associated to the z>2 spectroscopic survey forecast (article: ), written in python. 
As in the article, there are two categories: 
-codes for forecasting future surveys MegaMapper, MUST, MSE, WST
-codes for forecasting a general survey model, which make forecasts for a set of observational parameters (Vsur, pmin, NfibTsur...). 

## Codes for MegaMapper, MUST, MSE, WST
We forecaste BAO, RSD, NG and NM effects. Some codes are divided into 2 parts: 1-tracer and 2-tracers.

## Codes for the general survey model
These codes will be added later...
