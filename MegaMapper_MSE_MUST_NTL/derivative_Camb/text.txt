In this directory, there is a code to compute the derivative of the power spectrum (and growth function f), wrt cosmo parameters (6+Mnu).
We compute it for a set of (kj,zi) for P--> we get a matrix
We compute it for a set (zi) for f--> we get a vector

Since we need quite large sets ~9000 points, we compute it for once and save the results into files. Then for the Fisher matrix we simply use these files
